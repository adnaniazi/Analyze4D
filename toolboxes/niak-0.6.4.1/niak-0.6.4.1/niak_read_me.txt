= Neuroimaging Analysis Kit (NIAK) v0.6.4.1 =

NIAK is a library of modules and pipelines for fMRI processing with Octave or Matlab(r) that can run in parallel either locally or in a supercomputing environment. Linux OS and MINC file format are supported. Developers interested in using NIAK as a development library or to contribute to the project can consult the [http://code.google.com/p/niak/ NIAK google code] webpage. The wiki http://www.nitrc.org/plugins/mwiki/index.php/niak:MainPage is a detailed user guide with the following resources : 

*[[http://www.nitrc.org/plugins/mwiki/index.php/niak:Installation|Installation]] instructions. 
*[http://www.nitrc.org/frs/downloadlink.php/2726 Overview of NIAK] in pdf. 
*List of [[http://www.nitrc.org/plugins/mwiki/index.php/niak:NiakContributions|contributions]] to NIAK development and testing. 
*Tutorial of the [[http://www.nitrc.org/plugins/mwiki/index.php/niak:FmriPreprocessing|fMRI preprocessing]] pipeline;

Note that the most detailed and up-to-date documentation about NIAK functions can be invoked using standard matlab/octave (type "help ''function_name''").

=Contributions=

The kit was originally designed by [http://simexp-lab.org/brainwiki/doku.php?id=pierrebellec Pierre Bellec]&nbsp;who is still the main person responsible for its maintenance and development. The project started in the lab of [http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/~alan/ Alan C. Evans], Canada, 2008-10. The following people have directly helped to develop NIAK, either through code or ideas&nbsp;:

=== Institutions  ===

The following institutions are involved in the development and diffusion of NIAK&nbsp;: 

*[http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/ McConnell Brain Imaging Center (BIC)], [http://www.mni.mcgill.ca/ Montreal Neurological Institute], [http://www.mcgill.ca/ Mcgill University], Montréal, Canada. Most of the tools provided in NIAK have been developed at this institution over the past 15 years. 
*[http://www.unf-montreal.ca/siteweb/Home_fr.html Unité de neuroimagerie foncitonnelle], [http://www.criugm.qc.ca/ Centre de recherche de l'institut de gériatrie de Montréal (CRIUGM)], [http://www.umontreal.ca/ Université de Montréal], Montréal, Canada. This institution supports the lab of Pierre Bellec, and thereof the core of NIAK maintenance and development. 
*[http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/ Département d'informatique et de recherche opérationnelle (DIRO)], [http://www.umontreal.ca/ Université de Montréal], Montréal, Canada. This institution supports the lab of Pierre Bellec, and thereof the core of NIAK maintenance and development. 
*[http://www.imed.jussieu.fr/ Laboratoire d'Imagerie Fonctionnelle (LIF)], [http://www.inserm.fr/ Inserm], [http://www.upmc.fr/ Université Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC)], Paris, France. This institution has contributed a number of tools to NIAK through the inputs of Vincent Perlbarg. 
*[http://sp.cs.tut.fi/index.en.shtml Department of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology]. This institution has contributed a number of tools to NIAK through the inputs of Jussi Tohka. 
*[http://www.anu.edu.au/index.php Australia National University]. This institution has contributed a number of tools to NIAK through the inputs of Andrew Janke.

=== Opensource software  ===

Many of the functions of the kit are based on software developed over the years by members and collaborators of the BIC and most notably fMRIstat developed by the late [http://www.math.mcgill.ca/keith/ Keith Worsley] and NIAKified by Felix Carbonnell, the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/MINC MINC] tools and the [http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/users/yaddab/Yasser-HBM2006-Poster.pdf CIVET] pipeline. Other codes came from opensource projects (the detailed licenses are in the respective codes): 

*The pipeline system is a project called [http://code.google.com/p/psom/ PSOM] developed by Pierre Bellec (MIT license). 
*The NIFTI reader/writer is adapted from a [http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/loadFile.do?objectId=8797&objectType=file code] by [http://www.rotman-baycrest.on.ca/~jimmy/ Jimmy Shen] (BSD license). 
*The [http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/956 conversion] between rotation/translation and matrix representations of rigid-body motion by Giampiero Campa (BSD license). 
*The 'sinc' scheme for slice timing correction is a port from [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/ SPM] (GPL license). 
*The NIAK logo was adapted from an original work by the artist [http://mattahan.deviantart.com/ Mattahan] (creative commons license). 
*The spatial independent component analysis was extracted from [http://sccn.ucsd.edu/fmrlab/ fMRlab] (GPL license). 
*The windowed Fourier transfrom is from the [http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~wavelab/ WaveLab] toolbox (license&nbsp;: non-standard). 
*The mutli-dimensional scaling algorithm and implementation was generously contributed by [http://pgrc-16.ipk-gatersleben.de/~stricker/ Marc Strickert] as part of the NIAK project (MIT license).

Finally, a lot of people have been involved in beta-testing the project and gave very precious feedback over the past two years. A non-exhaustive list includes Benjamin D'hont, Pr Christophe Grova's lab, Pr Jean Gotman's lab, Pr Alain Dhager's lab, Pr Pedro Rosa-Neto's lab and Sébastien Lavoie-Courchesne.
