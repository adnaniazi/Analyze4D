% SUMMARY NIAK_GB_VARS
%
% This is a script to define important NIAK variables. Whenever needed, 
% NIAK commands will call this script to initialize the variables. If NIAK 
% does not behave the way you want, this might be the place to fix that.
%
% IF a variable called FLAG_GB_NIAK_FAST_GB is found in memory and is true,
% only a very limited number of global variables will be initialized.
