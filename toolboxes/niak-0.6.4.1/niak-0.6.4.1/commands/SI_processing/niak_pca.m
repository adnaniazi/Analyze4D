% SUMMARY NIAK_PCA
%
% Perform a principal component analysis on a 2D data array.
%
% SYNTAX:
% [EIG_VAL,EIG_VEC,WEIGHTS] = NIAK_PCA(DATA)
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% INPUTS
%
%  *  DATA
%       (2D array, size N*T) samples*variables data array. If data is a
%       time series array, the time would be the second dimension for a
%       spatial PCA (the variables here are the volumes), which corresponds
%       to TSERIES' for the usual NIAK conventions for array of time
%       series.
%
%  *  NB_COMP 
%       (real number, default rank of TSERIES) 
%       If NB_COMP is comprised between 0 and 1, NB_COMP is assumed to be
%       the percentage of the total variance that needs to be kept.
%       If NB_COMP is an integer, greater than 1, NB_COMP is the number of
%       components that will be generated (the procedure always consider
%       the principal components ranked according to the energy they
%       explain in the data. 
%           
%

% OUTPUTS
%
% *  EIG_VAL 
%       (vector, size NB_COMP*1) eigen values, which is also the energy
%       explained by each of the corresponding principal components.
%
% *  EIG_VEC 
%       (array, size T*NB_COMP) eigen vectors (in columns)
%
% *  WEIGHTS 
%       (array, size N*NB_COMP) the weights, i.e. the matrix such that
%       TSERIES = WEIGHT*EIG_VEC' in the case where NB_COMP == T, and
%       otherwise EIG_VEC*WEIGHT is simply the projection of TSERIES in the
%       PCA space of dimension NB_COMP with maximal energy.

% COMMENTS
%
% The PCA is done on the matrix of scalar products in the second
% dimension, i.e. DATA'*DATA.
