function [] = niak_seed_rand(seed)
% Change the seed of the uniform and Gaussian rand number generator
%
% SYNTAX:
% [] = NIAK_SEED_RAND(SEED)
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% INPUTS:
%
% SEED
%       (scalar, default sum(100*clock))) the seed of the random number 
%       generator.
%       
% _________________________________________________________________________
% OUTPUTS:
%         
% _________________________________________________________________________
% SEE ALSO:
% RAND, RANDN, RANDSTREAM
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% COMMENTS:
%
%   This function is, in general, simply equivalent to :
%   >> rand('state',seed)
%   >> randn('state',seed)
%
%   The exact method however depends on the version of Matlab and/or
%   Octave. 
%   This version should work for every version and language.
