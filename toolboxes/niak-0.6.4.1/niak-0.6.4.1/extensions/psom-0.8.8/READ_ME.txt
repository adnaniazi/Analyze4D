=ï»¿Pipeline System for Octave and Matlab (PSOM), version 0.8.8=

A pipeline is a collection of jobs, i.e. matlab or octave codes with a well identified set of options that are using files as inputs and are producing files as outputs. PSOM is a framework to implement, run and re-run pipelines in Matlab or Octave :
  * Describe the pipeline using a straightforward structure representation.
  * Automatically run jobs in parallel whenever possible using multiple CPUs or within a distributed computing environment.
  * Automatically generate log files and keep track of the pipeline description.
  * Handle job failures : successful completion of jobs is checked and failed jobs can be restarted.
  * Handle updates of the pipeline : change options or add jobs and let PSOM figure out what to reprocess !

PSOM is an opensource project distributed under an [http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php MIT opensource license]. It is currently in a beta-testing stage and has been tested under Linux (in Matlab and Octave) and windows (in Matlab). To install PSOM, just extract the [http://code.google.com/p/psom/downloads/list archive] in a folder and add that folder to your matlab or octave search path. You're done ! You may have to adapt the [http://code.google.com/p/psom/wiki/ConfigurationPsom configuration] to your local production environment. To use PSOM, you can have a look at the code of `psom_demo_pipeline`, or read [http://code.google.com/p/psom/wiki/HowToUsePsom the tutorial].

PSOM was implemented by Pierre [http://simexp-lab.org/brainwiki/doku.php?id=pierrebellec Bellec] in the lab of [http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/~alan/ Alan Evans] at the !McConnell Brain Imaging Center, Montreal Neurological Institute, !McGill University, Canada, 2008-10. Core ideas have been inspired by the [http://wiki.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/index.php/PoorMansPipeline Poor Man's Pipeline (PMP) project] developed by Jason Lerch, which was itself based on [http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/~jason/rppl/rppl.html RPPL] by Alberto Jimenez and Alex Zijdenbos.
